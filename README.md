#Safari Eolo Extension

This unofficial Safari Extension allows NGI Eolo users to monitor their traffic and VoIP quotas.

This is inspired by [Chrome Eolo Extension](https://github.com/alberanid/chrome_eolo_extension), anyway this version is much simpler and does not provide settings/error messages.
